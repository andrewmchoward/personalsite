        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>While I have always had the brain required for coding, it took me quite a while to decide that I actually
          enjoyed it. As such, I have put a full-time effort into teaching myself HTML, CSS, Javascript, and more
          in order to compete with those around me. I hope to become a full-time front-end developer, and
          finish creating my own video game as a side hobby.</p>

        <h3>Video Games</h3>
        <p>As a child, I had a dad who was a huge video game fan, playing Starcraft, Red Alert, and Heroes of Might and Magic
          often. As his son, I was also raised with a love for video games. While my childhood consisted of Nintendo 64
          games from the 90's, as I grew older I became more competitive, reaching top 10% in League of Legends, and
          top 1% in Overwatch. This love of video games has been a drive for me in learning
          programming.</p>
